Hello,

The goal of this video is to demostrate that the Wrapper is able to hash the CCNx content name into the IP field, in order to use OpenFlow switches to forward and monitor CCNx packets. 

The network for this demo described in the figure: 2 OpenFlow switches, 4 hosts a Floodlight controller.


Start the network using a Mininet script. In that script, CCNd on H1, H2, H3, H4 are also started and the flow table entries are populated on the OpenFlow switch.


Start the Wrapper on the H1, H2

Start the Server for content name ccnx:/nam on H4

Add a CCN forwarding entry to H3, to let it forward everything to Switch 1

Start the client on H3 to request the content ccnx:/nam


This is the entry for the interest request ccnx:/nam. The content name is hashed into the IP address destination, and this interest is forwarded towards the server.


If one in two Wrapper is stopped, the ccnx request fails.



Start another server for ccnx:/nam1 on H4 and request that content from H3.

 
Another entries is used for this content name.
